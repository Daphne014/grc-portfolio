# Week 8: Application Security from a Compliance Perspective

**SCWIST Cybersecurity Scholars Program | June 2026**
**Stream:** Cybersecurity (Virtual)

## What This Week Covered

How application vulnerabilities translate into compliance failures: when a broken application becomes a regulatory problem and what corrective action looks like.

---

## Why Application Security Is a Compliance Issue

A vulnerability that exposes user data is a privacy breach. A privacy breach triggers regulatory reporting. Regulatory failures carry legal and financial consequences.

Applications are where personal data is collected, processed, and stored. Broken access controls or unvalidated input expose the organisation not just to attackers but to regulators. In Canada, PIPEDA and PHIPA require organisations to implement reasonable safeguards. A broken application is evidence those safeguards were not in place.

## Case Study: Broken Access Control

A customer portal let users view invoices and update contact information. Broken access control meant users could view other customers' data just by navigating the application.

**What went wrong:** Access checks were not enforced. Personal data was visible to people with no authorisation to see it, a direct violation of data protection principles.

**Regulatory consequence:** Mandatory breach reporting under Canadian privacy law, individual notification, reputational damage, and potential penalties.

**Corrective actions:**
- Access controls fixed so each user only sees their own data
- Audit logs implemented to track access
- Affected users notified per breach notification requirements

**GRC takeaway:** The failure was not just technical. It points to a gap in how the application was reviewed before deployment: no access control testing, no privacy impact assessment, no breach response process in place.

## OWASP Top 10: The Compliance Lens

OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project) publishes the ten most common application security risks. In GRC, it serves as a practical framework for assessing application risk during audits and vendor reviews.

| Risk | Compliance Implication |
|------|------------------------|
| Injection | Data extraction or manipulation; potential mass breach |
| Broken authentication | Unauthorised account access; breach of confidentiality |
| Security misconfiguration | Default credentials in place; due diligence not met |
| Insufficient logging | No audit trail; breach investigation and reporting becomes impossible |

## Questions for Vendor Assessments and Internal Audits

- Has this application been assessed against OWASP or an equivalent standard?
- Are access controls documented and tested before deployment?
- Is there a privacy impact assessment for this application?
- What logging is in place, and how long are logs retained?
- Is there a breach notification process tied to this application?
